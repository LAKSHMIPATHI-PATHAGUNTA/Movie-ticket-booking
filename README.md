This project helps me deepen my understanding of backend development, specifically in areas like:

Creating and managing APIs using Express.
Working with MongoDB to store and manipulate data.
Linking front-end and back-end through Axios and React hooks.
Handling logic for booking systems, such as prioritizing seat allocation in a coach and handling real-time updates.
By working on this, Iâ€™m improving my ability to design scalable systems and learning how to manage client-server interactions effectively.

Features
Users can book between 1 and 7 seats.
Seats are allocated based on availability in the same row or nearest row.
Visual display of the seat layout, with availability highlighted.
Persistent seat information stored in a MongoDB database.
